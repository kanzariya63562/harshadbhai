#What is the purpose continue statement in python?


# In Python, the continue statement is used within loops to skip the remaining code inside the loop for the current iteration and move on to the next iteration. It essentially allows you to skip certain parts of the loop's body based on a specific condition, without exiting the loop entirely.

# The purpose of the continue statement is to control the flow of execution within loops, particularly in situations where you want to skip certain iterations based on certain conditions. Common use cases for the continue statement include:

# Skipping specific iterations: You can use continue to skip certain iterations of a loop based on a condition, without executing the remaining code within the loop for that iteration.

# Avoiding unnecessary processing: If there are certain conditions under which you don't want to execute certain code within a loop, you can use continue to skip that code and move on to the next iteration.

# Here's a simple example to illustrate the use of continue:

# python
# Copy code
# Print only odd numbers from 1 to 10
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue  # Skip even numbers
    print(i)
#In this example, the continue statement is used to skip even numbers (numbers divisible by 2) within the loop. When the condition if i % 2 == 0 evaluates to True for even numbers, the continue statement is executed, causing the loop to skip the print(i) statement and move on to the next iteration. As a result, only odd numbers are printed from 1 to 10.
