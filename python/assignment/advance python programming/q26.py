# What is Instantiation in terms of OOP terminology?.
 



#   In OOP, the creation and initialization of objects of a given class is a fundamental step. In Python, everything is an instance or an object. Class constructors, which are like blueprints, allow software engineers to create and initialize objects of a given class. This instantiation process follows the steps of instance creation and instance initialization and makes those objects ready to use. When a copy of a class is created that inherits all the class properties and functions, it is called instantiating a class. To instantiate a class in Python, the class like it is called a function, passing the arguments defined by the __init__ method. The newly created object is the return value.
