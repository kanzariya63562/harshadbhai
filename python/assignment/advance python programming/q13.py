# Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python?



# An error is an issue in a program that prevents the program from completing its task. In comparison, an exception is a condition that interrupts the normal flow of the program. Both errors and exceptions are a type of runtime error, which means they occur during the execution of a program.


# In Python, an error is an issue in a program that disrupts its normal execution. Errors are broadly categorized into two main types: syntax errors and exceptions.




#  Syntax Errors

# Syntax errors are detected by the Python parser before the program is executed. They occur when the code does not conform to the syntax rules of the Python language. These errors prevent the code from running and must be fixed before execution.



# Exceptions



# Exceptions are errors detected during execution. Unlike syntax errors, exceptions can be caught and handled, allowing the program to continue running or terminate gracefully. Exceptions are represented as objects and can be managed using exception handling constructs (try, except, else, and finally).
