# What is List? How will you reverse a list?

#In Python, a list is a versatile data structure that can hold a collection of items. Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their elements after they are created. Lists can contain elements of different data types, and they are ordered, meaning the items have a defined order, and you can access them by their index.




list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


print(list)




list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
list1.reverse()


print(list1)
