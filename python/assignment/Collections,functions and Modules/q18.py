# What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.




# Tuple: Tuples are immutable, meaning once a tuple is created, you cannot change the elements it contains. However, you can create a new tuple with different elements.








my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_list.append(5)  



print(my_list)


my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4)

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) 


print(my_tuple)
