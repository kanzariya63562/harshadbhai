    OOP : Object Oriented Programming 

    ==> SECURITY

    1. Class and Object 
    ==> Class (Logical Entity)
    HUMAN
    animal 
    => blueprint 


    ==> Object : (real world entity) :Physical Entity

    male,female,remote,cat,sparrow

    => intance of a Class
    Syntax :

    class ClassName 
    {
        properties:
        variables 
        functions()
        {

        }
    }

    const/let/var varName(obj) = new ClassName;
    varName(obj).properties


    2. Encapsulation : hiding details 
    ==> var and fun are bind/wrapped together in a single unit (class) which is called Encapsulation
    3. Abstraction 
    ==> access only those details which are necessary

    4. Inheritance: CODE REUSABILIT

    To access properties of one class to another class

    Parent : Prop 

    class parent 

    class Child
    Child  => access

    class Parent 
    {
        props
    }

    class Child extends Parent
    {

    }

    OBJECT MUST BE CREATED OF CHILD CLASS
